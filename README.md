# JWKS Project 2
Continuing on the previous Java Web Key Server, this uses SQLite in order to produce a clientside database file for the storage of private keys.

## Description
This continuation of the Java Web Key Server was programmed with the goal of adding the bare minimum to the complexity of the Project 1 base, with the only addition being the required prerequisite of SQLite.

## Getting Started
To begin, make sure that SQLite is running in the same folder as totally_not_my_privateKeys.db, and then run the python script using your terminal or IDE of choosing. 

### Dependencies
Cryptography 41.0.4
Pyjwt 2.8.0
SQLite 3.45.2
